# Responsive Website using HTML, CSS &  a little bit of JavaScript
 
#### This is my first reponsive website project which I have created by following this [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzpx_d_nHfg). I am very thankful to the youtube tutorial owner for creating such an amazing content which helped me to understand CSS better and clear my confusions.
